# Notes for CS 260
1/11/2024 - After completing the Github assignment, I have learned a lot of things that will be helpful in continuing this semester as well as in future courses and career opportunities. Some things that I learned are:
+ How Github works including commits, push and pull requests, forking, and requests.
+ How to use the git command in the console and the git functionality on VS Code.
+ How to set up a repository on Github and add files.
+ How to use markdown including headings, paragraphs, references, images and lists.

I am excited to learn much more in this class!

1/17/2024 - Today, after working on my startup specification, I have started to learn several things including:
+ How websites are built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
+ How websites run using web services and WebSocket.
+ How to create a sketch of a website using NinjaMock.com.
+ More features on github like adding images to a repository and linking those images within a different file.
