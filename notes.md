# Notes for CS 260
1/11/2024 - After completing the Github assignment, I have learned a lot of things that will be helpful in continuing this semester as well as in future courses and career opportunities. Some things that I learned are:
+ How Github works including commits, push and pull requests, forking, and requests.
+ How to use the git command in the console and the git functionality on VS Code.
+ How to set up a repository on Github and add files.
+ How to use markdown including headings, paragraphs, references, images and lists.

I am excited to learn much more in this class!
